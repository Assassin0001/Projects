Hello Everyone!
I have done a project with my team under BIRAC E-Yuva Fellowship programme in March 2022. Our problem statement was related to Air pollution ,specifically SMOG.
We made the proposed solution to upgrade the existing model of Smog tower to replace with small sized Smog tower with iFD as its main filter.
Our proposal got selected at preliminary round and We gave our presentation for next round.
Thanks
