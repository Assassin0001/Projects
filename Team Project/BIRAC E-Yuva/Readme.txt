Hello Everyone!
I have done a project with my team under the BIRAC E-Yuva Fellowship program in March 2022. Our problem statement was related to Air pollution, specifically SMOG.
We made the proposed solution to upgrade the existing model of the Smog tower to replace it with a small-sized Smog tower with iFD as its main filter.
Our proposal got selected in the preliminary round and We gave our presentation for the next round.
Thanks
